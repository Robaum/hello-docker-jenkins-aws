# hello-docker-jenkins-aws
This code is part of a series of tutorials on which you will learn how to install Vagrant to get a standardized development environment and using Ansible to provision such environment. Then you will make a Docker app that will print “Hello World” and a Docker Jenkins server. Then you will configure that Jenkins server to build, test and upload our Docker app to Dockerhub. If everything runs successfully Jenkins will run Ansible to connect to a AWS EC2 instance and install the new Docker app.

You can find the tutorials at [my blog](http://blog.robamador.com/how-to-make-your-project-workflow-effortless-with-docker-part-1/).
